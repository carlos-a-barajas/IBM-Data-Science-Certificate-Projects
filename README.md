Network Latency Prediction for Satellite Networks

# Network Latency Prediction for Satellite Networks

This project simulates satellite network conditions to predict latency using machine learning.

## Dataset
- Bandwidth (64, 128, 256 kbps)
- Number of network hops
- Time of day (0–23 hours)
- Simulated latency (ms)

## Model
- Random Forest Regressor
- MAE and R² used for performance evaluation

## Usage
Run the notebook to:
1. Simulate data
2. Train and test the model
3. Visualize results

## Output
- Actual vs. Predicted Latency scatter plot
